# Wait and Eat

This is the most recent version of the demo app for [The Angular Course](https://www.angularcourse.com).

Wait and Eat replaces paper waiting lists at restaurants.

If you're a restaurant-goer, you'll love the app because instead of waiting around
for your name to be called, you'll just get a text message when a table opens up.

Restaurant owners love the app because it makes managing waiting lists really easy, it reduces no shows,
and creates happier customers that are more likely to come back.
