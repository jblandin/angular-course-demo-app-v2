# Wait and Eat

This is the most recent version of the demo app for [The Angular Course](https://www.angularcourse.com).

Wait and Eat replaces paper waiting lists at restaurants.

If eat at restaurants a lot, you'll love the app because instead of waiting around
for your name to be called, you'll just get a text message when a table opens up.

If you own a restaurant, you'll love the app because it makes managing waiting lists really easy,
reduces no shows, and creates happier customers that are more likely to come back.

You can find a full working demo at http://www.waitandeat.com.

## Style

This app will be a great resource if you want to learn the latest best practices for
AngularJS code style and application structure.

That's because it follows [John Papa's AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide),
which is the style guide recommended by the AngularJS core team.

## What you'll learn

The main thing you'll learn is how to build and structure a large Angular app that
works with remote data, user authentication, and has all the major Angular features such as:

* Controllers
* Services
* Directives
* Promises

By reading and experimenting with the code, you'll also learn how to:

* Create separate modules for each feature.
* Create controllers that use services for most of the work.
* Safely inject dependencies that work after minification.
* Use `resolve` in your routes to get data before your controllers run.
* Use promises and also use promises that depend on other promises.
* Use `controllerAs` view syntax instead of $scope.
* Use `controllerAs` with `vm` instead of using `this`.
* Use `bindToController` in directives.
* Use `transclusion` in directives.

## Libraries used

* AngularJS 1.4.x
* Firebase 2.2.x
* AngularFire 1.1.x
* Bootstrap 3.3.x
